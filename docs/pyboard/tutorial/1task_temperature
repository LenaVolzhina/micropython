After exploring the temperature and humidity sensor and runing your first test script for it. We are now trying to combine the different hardware compnents.

Hardware needed for this task
pyboard lite with acc
Jumper Wire with male Pins
Temperature Sensor
LCD160CR

Wire up your Sensor to one of the I2C Ports (do you remember on which Pins they are, if not, you can always have a look at the Data sheet of the pyboard)
Take a look into the HDC1008 test program. The easiest way to show the meassured temperature and humidity on your Display is directing the REPL to the Display.

This looks not very nice.
Try to make two boxes for the temperature and the humidity values and show them on the Display.

Using the Adafruit Fether Huzzah

The same task can be done with the ESP8266
