Hello, pyboard!
--------
MicroPython is a reimplementation of the Python 3.x programing language. Most of your Python programming knowledge is directly useable in MicroPython.

After logging into the python promt on your pyboard, you can directly run your first lines of code::

>>> print("Hello, MicroPython pyboard!")

The code above will return::

>>> Hello, MicroPython pyboard!

Variables and Types
------
Python supports three types of numbers: integers, floating point numbers and complex numbers â€“ so does MicroPython::

>>> oneint = 4
>>> print(oneint)

will return::

>>> 4

To define a floating point number::

>>> onefloat = 4.0
>>> print(onefloat)
>>> onefloat=float(4)
>>> print(onefloat)

Will return::

>>> 4.0
>>> 4.0
