Hello, pyboard!
MicroPython is a reimplementation of the Python 3.x programing language.

After logging into the python promt you can run your first lines of code::

>>> print("Hello, MicroPython pyboard!")

The code above will return::

>>> Hello, MicroPython pyboard!

Variables and Types
Python supports three types of numbers: integers, floating point numbers and complex numbers â€“ so does MicroPython::

>>> oneint = 4
>>> print(oneint)

will return::

>>> 4

To define a floating point number::

>>> onefloat = 4.0
>>> print(onefloat)
>>> onefloat=float(7)
>>> print(onefloat)

Will return::

>>> 7.0
>>> 7.0
