Hello, pyboard!
--------
MicroPython is a reimplementation of the Python 3.x programing language. Most of your Python programming knowledge is directly useable in MicroPython. Please see the differences here: <internal link>`_,

For making you familiar with the REPL and the Python programming language in general please try some of the following tasks:

After logging into the python promt on your machine, you can directly interact with your pyboard. Get into it and run the first lines of your code::

>>> print("Hello, MicroPython pyboard!")

The code above will return::

>>> Hello, MicroPython pyboard!

Variables and Types
------
Python supports three types of numbers: integers, floating point numbers and complex numbers â€“ so does MicroPython. You can try it yourself with typing into the REPL::

>>> oneint = 4
>>> print(oneint)
4

To define a floating point number::

>>> onefloat = 4.0
>>> print(onefloat)
>>> onefloat=float(4)
>>> print(onefloat)

Will return::

>>> 4.0
>>> 4.0
